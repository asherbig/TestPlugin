This is a plugin that I made for a Bukkit Minecraft Server. 
It's my first plugin, and I'm going to play around with functionalities, and get a feel for the bukkit and spigot APIs

To compile into a jar, you need to use a maven install command.

To actually run the plugin on a server, you need to put the jar into the plugins folder in the server.
